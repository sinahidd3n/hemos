HemoCell's User guide
====================================

*When using HemoCell please* **cite** *the HemoCell paper* [#HC]_.

HemoCell implements an immersed boundary method with a lattice Boltzmann method
and langrangian structure points for the cells. The lattice Boltzmann method is
implemented with the help of the palabos library (`palabos.org`_). On top of that
HemoCell manages the structures (material, cells) and the interactions between
these and the fluid. The update of the forces of the mechanical model of a cell
are highly optimized as is the interaction between the fluid and the mechanical
model.
